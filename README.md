# OSSN-HomePagePost

This component allows users to decide to see posts from all or friends only by showing two options below the new post block in NewsFeed.

## Known issue

If any other component uses the ossn_get_homepage_wall_access() function it is necessary to change it to hpage_posts_get_homepage_wall_access() for everything to work correctly. As far as I know, this function is used in the following components:

- [HashTag](https://www.openteknik.com/product/view/2355/hash-tags>)
- [PopularPosts](https://www.openteknik.com/product/view/4869/popularposts)ยน. 

ยน Thanks to [Hugo](https://www.opensource-socialnetwork.org/u/Erassus) for testing and reporting
