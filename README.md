# OSSN-HomePagePost

This component allow users decides to see posts from all or friends only.

## How to use

1) Before enable this function, open components\OssnWall\ossn_com.php and comment (or delete, by your own risk) the block of function ossn_get_homepage_wall_access().
   I know of existence of runkit7_function_remove function but I don't like to enable a PHP component when you can comment some code.
2) Enable it!
3) In next OssnWall updates, you need to comment again the function :-/
